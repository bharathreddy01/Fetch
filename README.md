# Fetch Android Application

## Overview
The **Fetch Android Application** is designed to provide users with a seamless and efficient experience. This project demonstrates my expertise in developing Android applications, leveraging the latest technologies and best practices in mobile development.

## Features
- **Network Integration**: Utilizes internet connectivity to fetch and display data dynamically.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a modern and intuitive UI to enhance the user experience.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Built with modular and maintainable code to accommodate future enhancements.

## Technologies Used
- **Language**: Java/Kotlin
- **Framework**: Android SDK
- **Build Tool**: Gradle
- **UI Design**: Jetpack Compose
- **Testing**: JUnit and Android Instrumentation Tests

## Project Structure
- `app/`: Contains the main application code.
  - `src/main/java/`: Includes the core business logic and application structure.
  - `src/main/res/`: Contains the application's resources (layouts, images, and strings).
  - `AndroidManifest.xml`: Defines the app's structure, permissions, and entry points.

## Key Components
1. **Main Activity**: Entry point of the application.
2. **Jetpack Compose**: Used to create modern and responsive UI components.
3. **Retrofit**: For network calls and API integration.
4. **ViewModel**: To separate UI logic from business logic.

## Additional Features and Highlights

### Efficient Data Handling
1. While building the application, I implemented filtering logic to exclude items with blank or null names, ensuring the data displayed is meaningful.
2. I grouped items by `listId` and sorted them first by `listId` and then by `name` to make the list intuitive and organized.

### Modern UI with Jetpack Compose
1. I chose **Jetpack Compose** to develop the user interface for its modern, declarative nature and its ability to simplify UI creation.
2. I focused on creating a responsive design optimized for readability across various screen sizes.

### Robust Network Integration
1. I used **Retrofit** to fetch data from the provided API, ensuring reliable communication with the backend.
2. While developing, I added error handling for scenarios like network failures and invalid server responses to improve user experience.

### MVVM Architecture
1. I structured the application using the **Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM)** pattern to separate the data layer from the UI, making the codebase maintainable and scalable.
2. The ViewModel plays a critical role in managing and transforming the data before it reaches the UI.

### Scalable and Modular Codebase
1. I modularized the code to allow future enhancements with minimal refactoring.
2. I created reusable **composable components** in the UI layer for consistency and reusability.

### Build Compatibility
1. I configured the project to be buildable on the latest stable version of **Android Studio** and compatible with the current Android OS to ensure users can run the app seamlessly.

### User Experience Enhancements
1. While designing the app, I added a loading indicator to provide feedback during data fetch operations.
2. I also displayed error messages for issues like no internet connection or API errors, ensuring transparency and a better user experience.

### Testing
1. I integrated unit and instrumentation tests during the development process to validate the application's core functionality and UI behavior.
2. Testing ensured data validation and error handling were robust and worked as expected.
